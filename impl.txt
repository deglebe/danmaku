danmaku implementation notes (goals)

entities:
- player
- enemy
- boss
- bullets
- tokens

player entity has a few data fields:
- score (integer, point value)
	- collected by picking up point tokens
- power (integer, score value)
	- collected by picking up power tokens
- guns
	- player starts with 1 gun
	- gains a second gun at 200 power, a third at 500 power
	- base firing rate is 2 bullets/second on hold, no speed cap on press
	- at 500 power, the firing rate increases by 1/sec for every 100 power
- lives
	- player has three lives
	- if player dies, its power becomes pow = (current power * 0.3)
	- if it loses all three lives, game ends

the player can move all direction x, y, but is bounded by the playfield
the player should die if it collides with a bullet

enemies shoot bullets
bullets come in circle or star patterns
	- circle patterns are a circle comprised of 16 bullets shot out from
	  the enemy that travel away from the enemy
	- star patterns are lines of bullets that shoot away from the enemy
bullets can also be "tracker" bullets that are assigned a directional vector
toward the player at instance of being spawned, and move in that direction. if
the player moves, it does not follow the player.
enemies can survive 5 bullet shots from the player and are immune to the bullets
of other enemies
enemies need to be assigned what type of bullet pattern/mode they shoot
enemies move in all directions but eventually make their way to the bottom of
the screen where they disappear. 

the boss dies after 200 bullet impacts from player bullets
it shoots circles and stars and tracker bullets
the boss does not disappear, it has to be killed by the player
on death, the player wins

bullets are small orbs that shoot from enemies, players, or the boss
green bullets are regular, red are trackers, blue come from the player
these should be stored as three pngs
bullets disappear once hitting the bounds of the game

tokens are small rectangles that drop when enemies die and slowly fall to the
bottom of the playfield
red tokens are score tokens, blue are power tokens
if a player collides with the token, it should disappear and the value of the
token is applied to score or power respectively
